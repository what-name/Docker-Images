# Note
This is a very old project of mine. The code is pretty bad and way too complicated. I just wanted to include it here just because.

# HOW TO START
1. `docker-compose up -d`
2. navigate to http://localhost:90 on your computer

# Start & Stop
* To start: ```sudo docker start quotesite```
* To stop: ```sudo docker stop quotesite```
